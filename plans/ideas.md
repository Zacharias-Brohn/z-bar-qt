# Ideas/Features

- [x] Media showing; what song/media is playing?
- [x] Brightness control for Laptops.
- [x] Battery icon for Laptops. Broken?
- [ ] Change volume for `$BROWSER` environment variable? Most general media source apart from separate music/video players.
- [ ] Quick toggle for BT, WiFi (modules in the tray do this too)
- [x] Auto hide unless on mouse hover. Also implement bar changes to mute/volume to show notif or show bar for a couple seconds.
- [x] Maybe already possible; have keybinds to show certain menus. I do not want to touch my mouse to see notifications for example. Not everything in the bar needs this, but some would be good to have.
- [ ] Pressing ESC or some obvious button to close nc.
- [x] Another branch for development, hold off big changes so that a working bar or if there are big config changes.
