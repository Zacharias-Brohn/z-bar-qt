# Ideas/Features

* Media showing; what song/media is playing?
* Brightness control for Laptops.
* ~Battery icon for Laptops (better to have percentage shown instead).~
* Change volume for ```$BROWSER``` environment variable? Most general media source apart from separate music/video players.
* Quick toggle for BT, WiFi.
* Auto hide unless on mouse hover. Also implement bar changes to mute/volume to show notif or show bar for a couple seconds.
* Maybe already possible; have keybinds to show certain menus. I do not want to touch my mouse to see notifications for example. Not everything in the bar needs this, but some would be good to have.
